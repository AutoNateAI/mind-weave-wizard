FRAMEWORK CONSTRAINTS: You MUST create courses that follow this exact structure:
- Exactly 10 sessions
- Each session has exactly 3 lectures (5-7 minutes each)  
- Each session follows: Lecture → Game → Reflection pattern repeated 3 times
- Sessions progress: Graph Theory → Mental Models → Space Between → Research Decomposition → Traversal Techniques → Multiple Perspectives → Pattern Recognition → Advanced Applications → Professional Integration → Mastery & Beyond

Base the session titles, themes, and lecture content on the conversation, but ALWAYS maintain the core framework above.
